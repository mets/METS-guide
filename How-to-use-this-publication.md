A wide range of readers were envisioned as this document was being planned, written and edited.  As such, each chapter as presented can often stand alone.

**Chapter 1** serves as its Introduction, providing some general answers to the background and development of METS.  
**Chapter 2** is designed as an overview and basic tutorial for the use of METS.  It describes how to create a METS document.  
**Chapter 3** provides more specific documentation about the various elements within the METS schema.  The elements are organized in the order they appear in the METS.xsd.  
**Chapter 4** is targeted to the developer and XML aficionado who needs to know how XML specific methods are incorporated and designed to be used within the XML binding of the schema.  
**Chapter 5** provides an overview of the use of external schemas with METS for the different categories of metadata that can be partitioned within it including descriptive and administrative metadata.  The reader is directed to other sources of information for more specifics regarding the use of each schema that is endorsed by the METS Editorial Board.  
**Chapter 6** includes introductory material about METS profiles, but once again points to the more specific information found on the METS website about how to create METS profiles along with the list of registered profiles, and the sample instance documents that are required as part of registering a METS profile.  
**Appendix A** contains a full METS document example drawn from a few scanned page image files from Martial, Epigrams (2v.) London, W. Heinemann; 1919-20.  
**Appendix B** contains three sets of tables: ComplexTypes, Elements and Attributes arranged in alphabetical order for quick reference.
