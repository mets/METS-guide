# METS Profiles
## **Purpose of METS Profiles**
One of the most advantageous features of the METS schema is its flexibility; it can be adapted to fit local practice as well as locally-developed tools and work flows.  This same flexibility can also be a disadvantage, however, when institutions are looking to transfer METS files between and among each other for any number of purposes.  

As a mechanism to allow flexibility, but also to establish common practice among METS 2 users, a METS 2 profile schema is under development along with an updated process to make the profiles visible to others looking to implement and/or share data and metadata among those using a given profile.

## **Draft schema for a METS 2 Profile**

The current draft version of the  METS Profile Schema is available here: [Draft schema for METS 2 profiles](https://github.com/mets/METS-profiles/blob/profile-for-mets2/profile_docs/METS2_profile.xsd)
