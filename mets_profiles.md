# METS Profiles
## **Purpose of METS Profiles**
One of the most advantageous features of the METS schema is its flexibility; it can be adapted to local practices as well as locally developed tools and workflows. However, this same flexibility can also be a disadvantage, if institutions wish to transfer METS files between and among themselves for any number of purposes.  

As a mechanism to allow for flexibility, but also to establish common practices among METS 2 users, a METS 2 profile schema is under development, along with an updated process for making the profiles visible to others wishing to implement and/or share data and metadata among those using a given profile.

## **Draft schema for a METS 2 Profile**

The current draft version of the METS Profile Schema is available here: [Draft schema for METS 2 profiles](https://github.com/mets/METS-profiles/blob/profile-for-mets2/profile_docs/METS2_profile.xsd)
